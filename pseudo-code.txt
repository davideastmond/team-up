Sharer runs EXE
  - This will create a server on their computer
  - We also have to get the computer's local IP address
  - We need some sort of interface to tell sharer their local IP address and instruct them to share that with sharees




MIDDLE

Sharees visit sharer's server via local IP address on their browser
The local webpage has a name/email address form
Server tells the sharee the file/directory name, the size of their chunk of the file and the total filesize
Sharee clicks file to start downloading file/directory from sharer

Both local and remote server display download info, including who is downloading and their progress

Once the download is finished, instruct sharees to move to different network and visit the link to the file on our website to upload


END

Sharee visits the file's page on our website
Sharee signs in with their name/email
Sharee selects their file segment and clicks upload
  STRETCH: Verify user by checking their user/password combo matches the combo sent to local server

Once all the files are uploaded, recombine them

Make file available for download through link created in BEGINNING section
